# EXP-16: Exception Handling in C++

## Overview

This project demonstrates how **exception handling** works in C++ through a simple division program. It prompts the user to enter two numbers and safely handles the case of division by zero using `try-catch` blocks.

## Features

- **Input Handling:** Takes two floating-point numbers from the user.
- **Exception Handling:** Throws an exception if the second number (denominator) is zero.
- **Friendly Error Messages:** Displays a specific error message when a division by zero occurs.

## Code

The core logic of the program is implemented in [`division.cpp`]
